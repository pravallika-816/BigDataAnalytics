# Big Data Analytics with PySpark — Education Dataset (Mini Project)

This repository contains a sequence of PySpark lab exercises leading up to a Mini Project on Indian District Education Data Analysis. It demonstrates end-to-end PySpark usage — from data loading to analysis and visualization.

## Contents
- 1. Data Transformation Using PySpark RDD  
- 2. collect(), sample(), and takeSample() Operations  
- 3. Exploring CSV Data Structure and Schema  
- 4. Data Cleaning and Column Operations  
- 5. Analytical Operations on the Education Dataset  
- 6. Visualization and Insights  
- 7. Education Dataset Analysis Using PySpark (Mini Project)

Each notebook progressively builds toward the final mini project. The last notebook contains comprehensive analytics and visual insights from the district-level education dataset.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.9 or above  
- Apache Spark 3.x with PySpark  
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab  

Install PySpark locally via:
```bash
pip install pyspark jupyter

Running the Notebooks

Open terminal or Anaconda Prompt.

Navigate to the project directory:

cd "C:/Users/LENOVO/BDA"


Launch Jupyter Notebook:

jupyter notebook


Open the desired notebook and run all cells sequentially.

Education Data Analytics Report.pdf — Final report

Example Questions Explored

Which districts have the highest and lowest number of schools?

How are boys and girls distributed across school levels (Primary to Sr. Secondary)?

What is the retention rate of girls from Class X to Class XII?

Which districts perform best and worst in Class X and XII results?

How does school infrastructure relate to total student enrollment?

The notebook demonstrates data ingestion, transformation, aggregation, and visualization using PySpark and Matplotlib/Seaborn.

Lab Highlights

Data Cleaning and Schema Inference in PySpark

Grouping and Aggregation (groupBy, agg, count, avg)

Sorting and Filtering District Data

Creating Derived Columns (Retention %, Total Schools)

Writing Filtered DataFrames to CSV

Visual Analytics (Bar Charts, Comparative Graphs)

Key Results Summary

Total Districts Analyzed: 33

Total Schools (All Levels): ~660,000

Top Districts by School Count: North, South West, West

Top Performing Districts (Class X): Central, East, North East

Lowest Performing Districts (Class X): South West, West, North West

Highest Number of Girl Students: North, Central, East

Average Girls’ Retention (Class X to XII): ~82%

Balanced Gender Ratio: Girls constitute ~48% of total students

Conclusion

This project demonstrates how PySpark can efficiently process and analyze large-scale education datasets for district-level performance insights.
It highlights:

Complete workflow from ingestion to visualization,

Data-driven insights on gender participation and performance trends,

Scalable use of PySpark for educational policy and planning analytics.

Developed as part of Big Data Analytics Laboratory using Apache Spark and PySpark.

✅ When you run this cell in Jupyter, it will automatically create a clean `README.md` file in your working directory (`C:/Users/LENOVO/BDA`).  
Would you like me to also make a **short GitHub repo description** (one-line summary under the title)?
